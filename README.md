# Leetcode
This repository contains solutions to coding problems from [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/).

# Notes
* All solutions are developed in Python 3.x
* These may not be the best or the most optimal solutions.
* Every problem solution has its own folder with a ReadMe file for the problem statement, and the solution script.
* Each solution script contains documentation.
* Leetcode already provides you with a starting code snippet. I have tried to use that as much as possible for each problem.
* Each solution script contains the main() function that will help you run the script to see the results in the console. However, for LeetCode, you just need the code snippet (without the main() function) for submissions.

# Issues
* If you face any problems with any of the solutions, please feel free to open an issue [here](https://github.com/SouravDutta91/leetcode/issues).
* If you have a better solution for a specific problem, you can open a new pull request [here](https://github.com/SouravDutta91/leetcode/pulls).

# Copyright
* I recommend you not to blindly copy the solutions to Leetcode. Instead, please use them to learn and/or improve your coding skills and understanding.
* If you are directly using these solutions somewhere, it would be nice to acknowledge this repository.

Thank you. I hope this project helps you. Have fun coding and learning! :)
